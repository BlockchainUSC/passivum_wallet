# passivum_wallet
**Your savings account for crypto.**

Passivum is an account abstraction smart contract wallet built on top of the Biconomy SDK that allows users to stake their idle tokens in DEX liquidity pools for passive yields, all with just one click, and without paying any gas fee. Every account has social recovery features thanks to our custom module, which allows users to recover their wallet with the help of some friends' addresses should they lose their private key. Additionally, users can entrust their wallet to some receiver address, unlocking ownership to the receiver after some designated amount of years, or a "dead man's switch" for short. Gasless auto-staking in DEX pools with just one click is possible through ERC-4337 batch transactions and paymaster, rather than users having to go through the ordeal of signing separately for an approval, deposit, and then stake. 

This application prioritizes frictionless user experience using web3auth. Users can access their wallet by logging in to their social media or email, and even utilize the fiat-to-crypto API to purchase tokens all on the same platform.
